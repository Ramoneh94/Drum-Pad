# Drum-Pad
A drum pad (like the kind that DJ's use) for making music. The user can use a mouse or they can use the following keys (a,s,d,f,g,h) for the top and (z,x,c,v,b) for the bottom. I plan to add more HTML &amp; CSS to let the user know what keys they can press and more styling overall. 
# Synth-Pad-JS
updated sounds and styles: 

Each key glows random color, add css effects to add glow and add JS features to randomize color when key is pressed
